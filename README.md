# Introduction

This is example (but working) code for the algorithm for the
transition from CC-BY-SA to ODbL data. At this stage all the methods
are mocked out, but future development will add the ability to run
this against an `apidb` format database, or possibly a live API.

# Requirements

To run this, you'll need Ruby (probably >=1.9.3) and some gems,
which you can install with `bundle install`. Then you'll be able
to run:

 `ruby test.rb`

which will run the full range of unit tests. The test files can also
be individually run to concentrate on some aspects of the suite.

# Tools

A simple command-line tool, `check_history.rb`, is provided to query
an API and return information about the actions that the bot would 
execute, if it were running for real. If you find any results from 
this which are not as expected, then they would make good unit 
tests. Run `ruby check_history.rb --help` for more information on 
running the tool, and on the available options.

# Changeset redaction

The `redact_changeset.rb` script can be used to redact changesets. 
To use it, create a yaml config file using `get_auth.rb` and run it
with `ruby redact_changeset.rb`.

# Test-Driven Development

This code is intended to be read as a test-driven development. It's
very hard to read most code when it implements a complex algorithm,
especially when it is expected to be read by anyone not fluent in the
language of choice (i.e: Ruby). In order to improve the
understandability of the code, this project is intended to be
test-driven, with well-commented tests to define the functionality.
Hopefully these tests *are* quite easy to read, without being a ruby
expert.

Tests can be found in the various files prefixed 'test_'. For example
tests_node.rb contains a set of tests to run just involving nodes,
and this is a good place to start. You'll find tests which describe
nodes being created, moved, and having tags changed by various users
 (license change agreers and disagreers in various combinations).
A test then the gives the expected resulting actions which a bot
should be deciding upon, to put the node in a clean state, and to
redact versions from the editing history.

# Actions

The main algorithm in the code, in `change_bot.rb` takes the history
of an element and turns this into a set of "actions", where each 
action is one of:

1. Edit[new object]. This will be turned into an edit which is 
   pushed to the API. Note that the version number should be equal
   to the object that this will be applied on top of. Also, the
   changeset ID should be -1.
2. Delete[class, id]. This will be turned into a delete request
   and pushed to the API. Note that this and Edit are pretty much
   mutually exclusive.
3. Redact[class, id, version, visibility]. This will be a call to
   the special API call which hides a version in the history, and
   means that it won't be distributed any more. 

The redaction visibility has values `:hidden` and `:visible` and 
these *may* have different effects eventually. The intended
meanings are:

* Hidden: This version does not contribute to the final version of
  the object and must be completely hidden.
* Visible: This version contains information that cannot be 
  distributed, but may also contain information which contributes
  to the final version. In future implementations of the API, some
  of this information (authorship, metadata, etc...) may be made
  visible.
