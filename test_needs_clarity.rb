    # this is a node with some early bad content all of which has been eradicated many versions ago

    # to the removal of the tag. (that is, tax is put back in a separate context, we apply good faith in the agreeing mapper)
    #
    # NOTE: this needs some thought.
    # the issue is that the "foo=bar" tag re-added in v9 is the same as a tag added by
    # a decliner in v1. on the basis of identity it might be hard to tell whether this
    # is newly-surveyed data, or added by looking at the object's history. 
    #
    # so the question is: can a tag added by an agreer in a later version of an element, 
    # even though it may be similar to a previously-removed tag added by a decliner, be 
    # considered clean?
